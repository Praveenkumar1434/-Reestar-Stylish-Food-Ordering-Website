🚀 Project Title: Reestar – A Clean &amp; Simple Food Ordering Webpage 🛠️ Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3 (No JavaScript) 📱 Status: Static Webpage | Not Yet Responsive
👋 Introduction
Hi, I'm Praveen Kumar M, and this is my project "Reestar", built as part of my front-end learning journey. This project helped me improve my skills in web layout, styling, spacing, and hover effects using only HTML5 and CSS3 — without any JavaScript. The idea was to make an attractive, neat, and beginner-friendly food order site that mimics real-world UI design.

🧩 Key Features
🔝 Header Navigation – Clean, centered navigation bar with links
🍔 Food Cards – Attractive food items displayed in modern card layout
🎨 Hover Effects – Smooth animations on cards and buttons
📞 Contact Form – Simple form with Name, Age, Email & Submit button
💡 UI Design – Used Google Fonts, custom colors, shadows & transitions
